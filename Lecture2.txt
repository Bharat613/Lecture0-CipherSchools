Code efficiency : It is a broad term used to describe the reliability, speed, and programming methodology used in developing codes for an application. It is directly linked with algorithmic 
efficiency and the speed of runtime execution for software . The goal of code efficiency is to reduce resource consumption and completion time as much as possible with minimum risk to 
the business or operating environment

High-level languages and low-level languages are two types of programming languages. 
The main difference between the two is that low-level languages are closer to the system hardware and require knowledge of hardware to write instructions, whereas high-level programming 
languages are machine-independent languages that do not require hardware knowledge to write instructions 12345.

Here are some differences between high-level and low-level languages:

Programmer friendliness: High-level languages are programmer-friendly, whereas low-level languages are machine-friendly.
Memory efficiency: Low-level languages are more memory-efficient than high-level languages.
Ease of understanding: High-level languages are easier to understand than low-level languages.
Debugging complexity: Debugging is easier in high-level languages than in low-level languages.
Maintainability complexity: Low-level languages are more complex to maintain than high-level languages.
Portability: High-level languages are portable, whereas low-level languages are non-portable.
Platform independence: High-level languages are platform-independent, whereas low-level languages are platform-dependent.
Translation method: High-level languages need a compiler or interpreter for translation, whereas low-level languages need an assembler for translation.
